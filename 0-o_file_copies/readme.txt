Files like gpio.c and fat32.c were written for the course, so only the .o files are included in this repo (so we could make it public).
First off, you need your own version of ALL 140e labs (aka a functional libpi) to be able to run the programs in this repo. 
Furthermore, the 140e code must be in a folder with a PATH set as described here (https://github.com/dddrrreee/cs140e-25win/tree/main/labs/0-pi-setup)


In case you run make clean in one of the other directories, and would like to recover the .o files, copy over the files from this directory. 
This is just meant to be a place for backups for .o files, nothing more :)
